# 3D-Engine
3D viewport made using java, displays 3 dimensional models that are imported as .obj (wavefront) files.
to ensure that the program does not run into any problems, please make sure that any model you import is triangulated(each faces only has three sides)
this folder also comes with a few 3d models that you can test importing if you dont want to import your own
